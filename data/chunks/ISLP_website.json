ESL has become a popular text not\nonly in statistics but also in related fields. One of the reasons for ESL\u2019s\npopularity is its relatively accessible style. But ESL is best-suited for indi-\nviduals with advanced training in the mathematical sciences.\nAn Introduction to Statistical Learning, With Applications in R (ISLR)\n\u2014 first published in 2013, with a second edition in 2021 \u2014 arose from\nthe clear need for a broader and less technical treatment of the key topics\nin statistical learning. In addition to a review of linear regression, ISLR\ncovers many of today\u2019s most important statistical and machine learning",

In addition to a review of linear regression, ISLR\ncovers many of today\u2019s most important statistical and machine learning\napproaches, including resampling, sparse methods for classification and re-\ngression, generalized additive models, tree-based methods, support vector\nmachines, deep learning, survival analysis, clustering, and multiple testing.\nSince it was published in 2013, ISLR has become a mainstay of un-\ndergraduate and graduate classrooms worldwide, as well as an important\nreference book for data scientists. One of the keys to its success has been\nthat, beginning with Chapter 2, each chapter contains an R lab illustrating\nhow to implement the statistical learning methods seen in that chapter,\nproviding the reader with valuable hands-on experience.\nHowever, in recent years Python has become an increasingly popular lan-\nguage for data science, and there has been increasing demand for a Python-\nvii\nviii",

Several of the labs make use\nof the ISLP Python package, which we have written to facilitate carrying out\nthe statistical learning methods covered in each chapter in Python. These\nlabs will be useful both for Python novices, as well as experienced users.\nThe intention behind ISLP (and ISLR) is to concentrate more on the\napplications of the methods and less on the mathematical details, so it is\nappropriate for advanced undergraduates or master\u2019s students in statistics\nor related quantitative fields, or for individuals in other disciplines who",

These\ntools can be classified as supervised or unsupervised. Broadly speaking,\nsupervised statistical learning involves building a statistical model for pre-\ndicting, or estimating, an output based on one or more inputs. Problems of\nthis nature occur in fields as diverse as business, medicine, astrophysics, and\npublic policy. With unsupervised statistical learning, there are inputs but\nno supervising output; nevertheless we can learn relationships and struc-\nture from such data. To provide an illustration of some applications of\nstatistical learning, we briefly discuss three real-world data sets that are\nconsidered in this book.\nWage Data\nIn this application (which we refer to as the Wage data set throughout this",

In particular, we wish\nto understand the association between an employee\u2019s age and education, as\nwell as the calendar year, on his wage. Consider, for example, the left-hand\npanel of Figure 1.1, which displays wage versus age for each of the individu-\nals in the data set. There is evidence that wage increases with age but then\ndecreases again after approximately age 60. The blue line, which provides\nan estimate of the average wage for a given age, makes this trend clearer.\nGiven an employee\u2019s age, we can use this curve to predict his wage. However,\nit is also clear from Figure 1.1 that there is a significant amount of vari-",

Right: Boxplots displaying wage as a function of education, with 1\nindicating the lowest level (no high school diploma) and 5 the highest level (an\nadvanced graduate degree). On average, wage increases with the level of education.\nWe also have information regarding each employee\u2019s education level and\nthe year in which the wage was earned. The center and right-hand panels\nof Figure 1.1, which display wage as a function of both year and education,\nindicate that both of these factors are associated with wage. Wages increase\nby approximately $10,000, in a roughly linear (or straight-line) fashion,\nbetween 2003 and 2009, though this rise is very slight relative to the vari-\nability in the data.

Wages are also typically greater for individuals with\nhigher education levels: men with the lowest education level (1) tend to\nhave substantially lower wages than those with the highest education level\n(5). Clearly, the most accurate prediction of a given man\u2019s wage will be\nobtained by combining his age, his education, and the year. In Chapter 3,\nwe discuss linear regression, which can be used to predict wage from this\ndata set. Ideally, we should predict wage in a way that accounts for the\nnon-linear relationship between wage and age. In Chapter 7, we discuss a\nclass of approaches for addressing this problem.\nStock Market Data\nThe Wage data involves predicting a continuous or quantitative output value.\nThis is often referred to as a regression problem. However, in certain cases\nwe may instead wish to predict a non-numerical value\u2014that is, a categorical\nor qualitative output. For example, in Chapter 4 we examine a stock market",

Therefore, if we\ndetermine that there is an association between advertising and sales, then\nwe can instruct our client to adjust advertising budgets, thereby indirectly\nincreasing sales. In other words, our goal is to develop an accurate model\nthat can be used to predict sales on the basis of the three media budgets.\nIn this setting, the advertising budgets are input variables while sales input\nvariable\nis an output variable.

Linear Regression\nThree: Model Fit\nTwo of the most common numerical measures of model fit are the RSE and\nR2, the fraction of variance explained. These quantities are computed and\ninterpreted in the same fashion as for simple linear regression.\nRecall that in simple regression, R2 is the square of the correlation of the\nresponse and the variable. In multiple linear regression, it turns out that it\nequals Cor(Y, \u02c6Y )2, the square of the correlation between the response and",

As an example, we saw in\nTable 3.6 that for the Advertising data, the model that uses all three ad-\nvertising media to predict sales has an R2 of 0.8972. On the other hand,\nthe model that uses only TV and radio to predict sales has an R2 value\nof 0.89719.

The linear models that formed\nthe basis for this conclusion assumed that the effect on sales of increasing\none advertising medium is independent of the amount spent on the other\nmedia. For example, the linear model (3.20) states that the average increase\nin sales associated with a one-unit increase in TV is always \u03b21, regardless\nof the amount spent on radio.\nHowever, this simple model may be incorrect.

It is good practice to standardize the columns\nof X in these applications, if the variables are measured in different units.\nSince skl.ElasticNet() does no normalization, we have to take care of that\nourselves. Since we standardize first, in order to find coefficient estimates\non the original scale, we must unstandardize the coefficient estimates.

In Section 7.7, we show that these approaches can be seamlessly in-\ntegrated in order to model a response Y as a function of several predictors\nX1, . . . , Xp.\n7.1\nPolynomial Regression\nHistorically, the standard way to extend linear regression to settings in\nwhich the relationship between the predictors and the response is non-\nlinear has been to replace the standard linear model\nyi = \u03b20 + \u03b21xi + \u03f5i\nwith a polynomial function\nyi = \u03b20 + \u03b21xi + \u03b22x2\ni + \u03b23x3\ni + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + \u03b2dxd\ni + \u03f5i,\n(7.1)\nwhere \u03f5i is the error term.

We can use these to compute the\nestimated variance of \u02c6f(x0).1 The estimated pointwise standard error of\n\u02c6f(x0) is the square-root of this variance. This computation is repeated\nat each reference point x0, and we plot the fitted curve, as well as twice\nthe standard error on either side of the fitted curve. We plot twice the\nstandard error because, for normally distributed error terms, this quantity\ncorresponds to an approximate 95 % confidence interval.\nIt seems like the wages in Figure 7.1 are from two distinct populations:\nthere appears to be a high earners group earning more than $250,000 per\nannum, as well as a low earners group.

It turns out that we can use the basis model (7.7) to represent\na regression spline. A cubic spline with K knots can be modeled as\nyi = \u03b20 + \u03b21b1(xi) + \u03b22b2(xi) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + \u03b2K+3bK+3(xi) + \u03f5i,\n(7.9)\nfor an appropriate choice of basis functions b1, b2, . . . , bK+3. The model\n(7.9) can then be fit using least squares.\nJust as there were several ways to represent polynomials, there are also\nmany equivalent ways to represent cubic splines using different choices of\nbasis functions in (7.9). The most direct way to represent a cubic spline\nusing (7.9) is to start off with a basis for a cubic polynomial\u2014namely,\nx, x2, and x3\u2014and then add one truncated power basis function per knot. truncated\npower basis",

In three dimensions, a\nhyperplane is a flat two-dimensional subspace\u2014that is, a plane. In p > 3\ndimensions, it can be hard to visualize a hyperplane, but the notion of a\n(p \u22121)-dimensional flat subspace still applies.\nThe mathematical definition of a hyperplane is quite simple. In two di-\nmensions, a hyperplane is defined by the equation\n\u03b20 + \u03b21X1 + \u03b22X2 = 0\n(9.1)\nfor parameters \u03b20, \u03b21, and \u03b22.

When we say that (9.1) \u201cdefines\u201d the hyper-\nplane, we mean that any X = (X1, X2)T for which (9.1) holds is a point\non the hyperplane. Note that (9.1) is simply the equation of a line, since\nindeed in two dimensions a hyperplane is a line.\nEquation 9.1 can be easily extended to the p-dimensional setting:\n\u03b20 + \u03b21X1 + \u03b22X2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + \u03b2pXp = 0\n(9.2)\ndefines a p-dimensional hyperplane, again in the sense that if a point X =\n(X1, X2, . . . , Xp)T in p-dimensional space (i.e. a vector of length p) satisfies\n(9.2), then X lies on the hyperplane.\nNow, suppose that X does not satisfy (9.2); rather,\n\u03b20 + \u03b21X1 + \u03b22X2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + \u03b2pXp > 0.\n(9.3)\nThen this tells us that X lies to one side of the hyperplane.

A convolution filter relies on a very simple operation,\ncalled a convolution, which basically amounts to repeatedly multiplying\nmatrix elements and then adding the results.\nTo understand how a convolution filter works, consider a very simple\nexample of a 4 \u00d7 3 image:\nOriginal Image =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\ng\nh\ni\nj\nk\nl\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb.\nNow consider a 2 \u00d7 2 filter of the form\nConvolution Filter =\n3\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b3\n\u03b4\n4\n.\nWhen we convolve the image with the filter, we get the result7\nConvolved Image =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\na\u03b1 + b\u03b2 + d\u03b3 + e\u03b4\nb\u03b1 + c\u03b2 + e\u03b3 + f\u03b4\nd\u03b1 + e\u03b2 + g\u03b3 + h\u03b4\ne\u03b1 + f\u03b2 + h\u03b3 + i\u03b4\ng\u03b1 + h\u03b2 + j\u03b3 + k\u03b4\nh\u03b1 + i\u03b2 + k\u03b3 + l\u03b4\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb.\nFor instance, the top-left element comes from multiplying each element in\nthe 2 \u00d7 2 filter by the corresponding element in the top left 2 \u00d7 2 portion",

The other elements are obtained in a\nsimilar way: the convolution filter is applied to every 2\u00d72 submatrix of the\noriginal image in order to obtain the convolved image. If a 2 \u00d7 2 submatrix\nof the original image resembles the convolution filter, then it will have a\nlarge value in the convolved image; otherwise, it will have a small value.\nThus, the convolved image highlights regions of the original image that\nresemble the convolution filter.\nWe have used 2 \u00d7 2 as an example; in\ngeneral convolution filters are small \u21131 \u00d7 \u21132 arrays, with \u21131 and \u21132 small\npositive integers that are not necessarily equal.\nFigure 10.7 illustrates the application of two convolution filters to a 192\u00d7\n179 image of a tiger, shown on the left-hand side.8 Each convolution filter",

It turns out that if we consider all pairs consisting of\none observation in Class 1 and one observation in Class 2, then the AUC\nis the fraction of pairs for which the score for the observation in Class 1\nexceeds the score for the observation in Class 2.\nThis suggests a way to generalize the notion of AUC to survival anal-\nysis.

For example, in the Publication example, time zero for\neach paper was defined to be the calendar time at the end of the study,\nand the failure time was defined to be the number of months that elapsed\nfrom the end of the study until the paper was published.\nHowever, in other settings, the definitions of time zero and failure time\nmay be more subtle. For example, when examining the association between\nrisk factors and disease occurrence in an epidemiological study, one might\nuse the patient\u2019s age to define time, so that time zero is the patient\u2019s date\nof birth. With this choice, the association between age and survival cannot\nbe measured; however, there is no need to adjust for age in the analysis.\nWhen examining covariates associated with disease-free survival (i.e. the\n488\n11.

In this case, we can think of the blood\npressure for the ith observation not as xi, but rather as xi(t) at time t.\nBecause the partial likelihood in (11.16) is constructed sequentially in\ntime, dealing with time-dependent covariates is straightforward. In partic-\nular, we simply replace xij and xi\u2032j in (11.16) with xij(yi) and xi\u2032j(yi),\nrespectively; these are the current values of the predictors at time yi.

While results from the Cox model tend\nto be fairly robust to violations of this assumption, it is still a good idea to\ncheck whether it holds. In the case of a qualitative feature, we can plot the\nlog hazard function for each level of the feature. If (11.14) holds, then the\nlog hazard functions should just differ by a constant, as seen in the top-left\npanel of Figure 11.4.

We see that the choice of linkage\ncertainly does affect the results obtained. Typically, single linkage will tend\nto yield trailing clusters: very large clusters onto which individual observa-\ntions attach one-by-one. On the other hand, complete and average linkage\ntend to yield more balanced, attractive clusters. For this reason, complete\nand average linkage are generally preferred to single linkage. Clearly cell\nlines within a single cancer type do tend to cluster together, although the\nclustering is not perfect.
