    "text": "wishes to understand data \u2014 and as more and more of today\u2019s jobs involve\ndata, this means that statistical learning is fast becoming a critical toolkit\nfor everyone.\nOne of the first books on statistical learning \u2014 The Elements of Statisti-\ncal Learning (ESL, by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman) \u2014 was published\nin 2001, with a second edition in 2009. ESL has become a popular text not\nonly in statistics but also in related fields. One of the reasons for ESL\u2019s\npopularity is its relatively accessible style. But ESL is best-suited for indi-\nviduals with advanced training in the mathematical sciences.\nAn Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL) arose from the clear need\nfor a broader and less technical treatment of the key topics in statistical\nlearning. The intention behind ISL is to concentrate more on the applica-\ntions of the methods and less on the mathematical details. Beginning with\nChapter 2, each chapter in ISL contains a lab illustrating how to implement",

Beginning with\nChapter 2, each chapter in ISL contains a lab illustrating how to implement\nthe statistical learning methods seen in that chapter using the popular sta-\ntistical software package R. These labs provide the reader with valuable\nhands-on experience.\nISL is appropriate for advanced undergraduates or master\u2019s students in\nStatistics or related quantitative fields, or for individuals in other disciplines\nwho wish to use statistical learning tools to analyze their data. It can be\nused as a textbook for a course spanning two semesters.\nviii\nThe first edition of ISL covered a number of important topics, including\nsparse methods for classification and regression, decision trees, boosting,\nsupport vector machines, and clustering. Since it was published in 2013, it\nhas become a mainstay of undergraduate and graduate classrooms across\nthe United States and worldwide, as well as a key reference book for data\nscientists.",

In particular, the second edition includes new chapters on deep\nlearning (Chapter 10), survival analysis (Chapter 11), and multiple testing\n(Chapter 13). We have also substantially expanded some chapters that were\npart of the first edition: among other updates, we now include treatments\nof naive Bayes and generalized linear models in Chapter 4, Bayesian addi-\ntive regression trees in Chapter 8, and matrix completion in Chapter 12.\nFurthermore, we have updated the R code throughout the labs to ensure\nthat the results that they produce agree with recent R releases.\nWe are grateful to these readers for providing valuable comments on the\nfirst edition of this book: Pallavi Basu, Alexandra Chouldechova, Patrick",

These\ntools can be classified as supervised or unsupervised. Broadly speaking,\nsupervised statistical learning involves building a statistical model for pre-\ndicting, or estimating, an output based on one or more inputs. Problems of\nthis nature occur in fields as diverse as business, medicine, astrophysics, and\npublic policy.

To provide an illustration of some applications of\nstatistical learning, we briefly discuss three real-world data sets that are\nconsidered in this book.\nWage Data\nIn this application (which we refer to as the Wage data set throughout this\nbook), we examine a number of factors that relate to wages for a group of\nmen from the Atlantic region of the United States. In particular, we wish\nto understand the association between an employee\u2019s age and education, as\nwell as the calendar year, on his wage. Consider, for example, the left-hand\npanel of Figure 1.1, which displays wage versus age for each of the individu-\nals in the data set.

On average, wage increases with the level of education.\nGiven an employee\u2019s age, we can use this curve to predict his wage. However,\nit is also clear from Figure 1.1 that there is a significant amount of vari-\nability associated with this average value, and so age alone is unlikely to\nprovide an accurate prediction of a particular man\u2019s wage.\nWe also have information regarding each employee\u2019s education level and\nthe year in which the wage was earned. The center and right-hand panels\nof Figure 1.1, which display wage as a function of both year and education,\nindicate that both of these factors are associated with wage. Wages increase\nby approximately $10,000, in a roughly linear (or straight-line) fashion,\nbetween 2003 and 2009, though this rise is very slight relative to the vari-\nability in the data. Wages are also typically greater for individuals with",

Wages are also typically greater for individuals with\nhigher education levels: men with the lowest education level (1) tend to\nhave substantially lower wages than those with the highest education level\n(5). Clearly, the most accurate prediction of a given man\u2019s wage will be\nobtained by combining his age, his education, and the year. In Chapter 3,\nwe discuss linear regression, which can be used to predict wage from this\ndata set. Ideally, we should predict wage in a way that accounts for the\nnon-linear relationship between wage and age. In Chapter 7, we discuss a\nclass of approaches for addressing this problem.\n1.

In the 1940s, various authors put\nforth an alternative approach, logistic regression. In the early 1970s, the\nterm generalized linear model was developed to describe an entire class of\nstatistical learning methods that include both linear and logistic regression\nas special cases.\nBy the end of the 1970s, many more techniques for learning from data\nwere available.

It means\nthat on the basis of one particular set of observations y1, . . . , yn, \u02c6\u00b5 might\noverestimate \u00b5, and on the basis of another set of observations, \u02c6\u00b5 might\nunderestimate \u00b5. But if we could average a huge number of estimates of\n\u00b5 obtained from a huge number of sets of observations, then this average\nwould exactly equal \u00b5. Hence, an unbiased estimator does not systematically\nover- or under-estimate the true parameter. The property of unbiasedness\nholds for the least squares coe\ufb00icient estimates given by (3.4) as well: if\nwe estimate \u03b20 and \u03b21 on the basis of a particular data set, then our\nestimates won\u2019t be exactly equal to \u03b20 and \u03b21.

We also have data for\nthe amount of money spent advertising on the radio and in newspapers,\nand we may want to know whether either of these two media is associated\nwith sales. How can we extend our analysis of the advertising data in order\nto accommodate these two additional predictors?\nOne option is to run three separate simple linear regressions, each of\nwhich uses a different advertising medium as a predictor.

Linear Regression\nThree: Model Fit\nTwo of the most common numerical measures of model fit are the RSE and\nR2, the fraction of variance explained. These quantities are computed and\ninterpreted in the same fashion as for simple linear regression.\nRecall that in simple regression, R2 is the square of the correlation of the\nresponse and the variable. In multiple linear regression, it turns out that it\nequals Cor(Y, \u02c6Y )2, the square of the correlation between the response and",

For example, the points in\nFigure 3.8 seem to have a quadratic shape, suggesting that a model of the quadratic\nform\nmpg = \u03b20 + \u03b21 \u00d7 horsepower + \u03b22 \u00d7 horsepower2 + \u03f5\n(3.36)\nmay provide a better fit. Equation 3.36 involves predicting mpg using a\nnon-linear function of horsepower. But it is still a linear model!

We see that when K = 1, the KNN fit perfectly\ninterpolates the training observations, and consequently takes the form\nof a step function. When K = 9, the KNN fit still is a step function, but\naveraging over nine observations results in much smaller regions of constant\nprediction, and consequently a smoother fit. In general, the optimal value\nfor K will depend on the bias-variance tradeoff, which we introduced in\nChapter 2. A small value for K provides the most flexible fit, which will\nhave low bias but high variance. This variance is due to the fact that the\nprediction in a given region is entirely dependent on just one observation.\nIn contrast, larger values of K provide a smoother and less variable fit; the\nprediction in a region is an average of several points, and so changing one\nobservation has a smaller effect.

These methods can be used to\nidentify the optimal value of K in KNN regression.\nIn what setting will a parametric approach such as least squares linear re-\ngression outperform a non-parametric approach such as KNN regression?\nThe answer is simple: the parametric approach will outperform the non-\nparametric approach if the parametric form that has been selected is close\nto the true form of f.

Then X is assigned to the class to which the plurality of these\nobservations belong. Hence KNN is a completely non-parametric approach:\nno assumptions are made about the shape of the decision boundary. We\nmake the following observations about KNN:\n4.5 A Comparison of Classification Methods\n161\n\u2022 Because KNN is completely non-parametric, we can expect this ap-\nproach to dominate LDA and logistic regression when the decision\nboundary is highly non-linear, provided that n is very large and p is\nsmall.\n\u2022 In order to provide accurate classification, KNN requires a lot of ob-\nservations relative to the number of predictors\u2014that is, n much larger",

There are\nlikely to be many sets of 17 SNPs that would predict blood pressure just\nas well as the selected model.

However, stan-\ndard linear regression can have significant limitations in terms of predic-\ntive power. This is because the linearity assumption is almost always an\napproximation, and sometimes a poor one. In Chapter 6 we see that we can\nimprove upon least squares using ridge regression, the lasso, principal com-\nponents regression, and other techniques. In that setting, the improvement\nis obtained by reducing the complexity of the linear model, and hence the\nvariance of the estimates. But we are still using a linear model, which can\nonly be improved so far! In this chapter we relax the linearity assumption\nwhile still attempting to maintain as much interpretability as possible.

It turns out that we can use the basis model (7.7) to represent\na regression spline.

In three dimensions, a\nhyperplane is a flat two-dimensional subspace\u2014that is, a plane. In p > 3\ndimensions, it can be hard to visualize a hyperplane, but the notion of a\n(p \u22121)-dimensional flat subspace still applies.\nThe mathematical definition of a hyperplane is quite simple. In two di-\nmensions, a hyperplane is defined by the equation\n\u03b20 + \u03b21X1 + \u03b22X2 = 0\n(9.1)\nfor parameters \u03b20, \u03b21, and \u03b22.

But in\na larger data set with p > 2 variables, there are multiple distinct principal\ncomponents, and they are defined in a similar manner. To find \u03c62, we solve\na problem similar to (12.3) with \u03c62 replacing \u03c61, and with the additional\nconstraint that \u03c62 is orthogonal to \u03c61.2\nOnce we have computed the principal components, we can plot them\nagainst each other in order to produce low-dimensional views of the data.\nFor instance, we can plot the score vector Z1 against Z2, Z1 against Z3,",
